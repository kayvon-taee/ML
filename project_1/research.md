white wine, where the equilibrium between the freshness and sweet taste is
more appreciated. Moreover, the volatile acidity has a negative impact, since
acetic acid is the key ingredient in vinegar. The most intriguing result is the
high importance of sulphates, ranked first for both cases. Oenologically this
result could be very interesting. An increase in sulphates might be related to
the fermenting nutrition, which is very important to improve the wine aroma.

Higher sugar produces more alcohol. Think about sweeter grapes and the quality of the wine. **So, can investigate trends between alcohol/sugar against quality for different types of wine**.

More sulfates implies more fermentation - they prevent the growth of the bacteria that make the drink go cloudy and literally turn the alcohol to vinegar. 
More sulfates => duller taste in wine. However, sulfates are needed for aroma, so a balance must be struck. **Explore the optimal balance for both wines, as that was found to be important from study.**

Chloride ions are affected by grape type and the terroir (The soil and land where the grape is grown). Using salty water increases chloride ions.
-> Red and white difference - one removes the skin. Could skin contain traces of chloride?
  -> The skin may not naturally contain chloride, but this could be acquired through the soil. Find evidence of this. _Evidence can be found in Chloride concentration in red wines: Influence of terroir and grape type_.

> Mineral elements found in grapes and wines are absorbed
from the soil through the roots of the vine. They are present
mainly in the skin, seeds and cellular walls of the pulp of the
grape. The mineral composition of a wine reflects its particular
origin and development, making it unique and identifiable.

Investigate to see if there are any trends between chloride and quality of wines.
